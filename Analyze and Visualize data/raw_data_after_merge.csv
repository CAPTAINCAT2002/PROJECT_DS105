This HP touchscreen laptop displays everything from games to the latest shows in stunning quality thanks to its 1080p, micro-edge, anti-glare screen (1). Not only does your content look great, but you can interact with it too with intuitive touchscreen controls.

Stay powerfully connected from morning till evening with up to 11 hours and 30 minutes of battery life on a single charge (5). And in case you need additional power fast, recharge from 0 to 50% in approximately 30 minutes with HP Fast Charge technology (6). This Windows 11 laptop gives you a fresh perspective as you connect, game, and create in new ways (7). Enjoy all the new features this latest operating system has to offer with the peace of mind of HP's 1-year limited warranty to cover your Windows laptop. Just as reliable as the battery life and as new as the operating system, this traditional laptop computer features a Wi-Fi 5 (2x2) WLAN adapter and Bluetooth® 5.0 combo (8) (9). Because little things make a big difference, HP has designed this ultra-thin laptop to be ergonomic and productive.

Actual battery life will vary depending on configuration and maximum capacity will naturally decrease with time and usage. (6) Recharges your battery up to 50% within 30 minutes when the system is off (using the “shut down” command). Recommended for use with the HP adapter provided with the notebook, not recommended with a smaller capacity battery charger. After charging has reached 50% capacity, the charging speed will return to normal speed. Charging time may vary +/-10% due to System tolerance. (7) Not all features are available in all editions or versions of Windows. Systems may require upgraded and/or separately purchased hardware, drivers, software, or BIOS update to take full advantage of Windows functionality. Windows is automatically updated and enabled. High-speed internet and Microsoft account required. ISP fees may apply and additional requirements may apply over time for updates. See http://www.windows.com.

### ###Travel farther and do more with the Lenovo IdeaPad 3i laptop computer. Designed with ultimate portability in mind, you can work, study, or play wherever you need. The powerful 12th generation Intel® Core™ i5 U series processors keep you performing at your best, while the Intel® Iris® Xe graphics – as well as plenty of screen real estate on the 15.6"" FHD IPS display – lets you enjoy better color accuracy and contrast. Plus, the IdeaPad 3i laptop is slim, sleek, and lightweight, making it easy to carry no matter where you go. Slip it into your favorite Lenovo laptop bag and carry it to school, to work, when you're traveling, or even to your favorite coffee shop when you need a break from working from home. The full-function Type-C™ port on this Windows laptop helps you connect displays, power your devices, and enables faster data transfer. But that's not your only option for connectivity – in addition to that USB-C port, the IdeaPad 3i also has two USB-A ports (one USB 3.2 and one 2.0), an HDMI™ port, an SD card reader, and an audio jack, plus built-in WiFi and Bluetooth®. Chat with colleagues or friends on the 720p HD camera with dual microphones, Dolby Audio®, and Smart Noise Cancelling. And when your call is done, just slide the physical privacy shutter over the webcam to ensure your privacy. The long-life battery will keep you going, and you can grab another 2 hours of battery life when you're on the go by charging just 15 minutes with Rapid Charge Boost.### ###",,,DDR4 SDRAM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

### ###Built in security features ensure you're protected from viruses and malware. No setup or long load times simply log in with a Google account, and you're in. Navigate your world with Chrome OS. Get the best of Google, Gmail, Maps, docs and pics and back everything up safely in the cloud. And since your Chromebook gets free updates automatically, it will only get better. A battery that gets up to 11 hours on a single charge means you can view the news over coffee in the morning, CHECK emails at lunch then surf social media after dinner, all without having to recharge. Plus it's made for the long run, since it continues to retain most of its capacity even after 3 years' use. The strong design you'd expect from a reliable brand like Samsung. Go ahead, let the kids use it to watch movies during snack time, or keep it in the kitchen without worrying about accidents thanks to a water resistant keyboard.### ###",,11 Hours,DDR2 SDRAM,,1366x768,725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actual battery life will vary and depends on many factors such as product configuration and usage, software use, wireless functionality, power management settings, and screen brightness. The maximum capacity of the battery will decrease with time and use.### ###",,10 Hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The powerful 12th generation Intel® Core™ i5 U series processors keep you performing at your best, while the Intel® Iris® Xe graphics – as well as plenty of screen real estate on the 15.6"" FHD IPS display – lets you enjoy better color accuracy and contrast. Plus, the IdeaPad 3i laptop is slim, sleek, and lightweight, making it easy to carry no matter where you go. Slip it into your favorite Lenovo laptop bag and carry it to school, to work, when you're traveling, or even to your favorite coffee shop when you need a break from working from home. The full-function Type-C™ port on this Windows laptop helps you connect displays, power your devices, and enables faster data transfer. But that's not your only option for connectivity – in addition to that USB-C port, the IdeaPad 3i also has two USB-A ports (one USB 3.2 and one 2.0), an HDMI™ port, an SD card reader, and an audio jack, plus built-in WiFi and Bluetooth®. Chat with colleagues or friends on the 720p HD camera with dual microphones, Dolby Audio®, and Smart Noise Cancelling. And when your call is done, just slide the physical privacy shutter over the webcam to ensure your privacy. The long-life battery will keep you going, and you can grab another 2 hours of battery life when you're on the go by charging just 15 minutes with Rapid Charge Boost.### ###",,,DDR4 SDRAM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stream your favorite movies, browse and shop online, and connect with others with the Lenovo IdeaPad 1i laptop. WiFi and Bluetooth® are built right in, and you'll enjoy a variety of ports, including USB-C and USB-A, HDMI™, an SD card reader, and an audio jack.

No matter where you travel, this easy to use, portable laptop is ready to help you perform.###* All battery life claims are approximate. Actual battery life will vary and depends on many factors such as product configuration and usage, software use, wireless functionality, power management settings, and screen brightness. The maximum capacity of the battery will decrease with time and use.### ###",,10 Hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stream your favorite movies, browse and shop online, and connect with others with the Lenovo IdeaPad 1i laptop. WiFi and Bluetooth® are built right in, and you'll enjoy a variety of ports, including USB-C and USB-A, HDMI™, an SD card reader, and an audio jack.

### ###ZenBook Pro is designed to entice you with pure, unadulterated power. Power to create your dreams. Power to fuel your imagination. Power to do whatever you want to do, anywhere and everywhere. Every part of ZenBook Pro has been crafted to make it faster, more powerful and more amazing than the previous generation from its latest 7th Generation Intel Core i7 processor to its gaming-grade NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics and quad-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound audio. And every detail of its finish makes it even more beautiful than ever before including its precision-engineered solid-aluminum unibody and stunning FHD NanoEdge display. Extreme Power The ZenBook Pro features up to a 7th Generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor with 16GB of DDR4 RAM and gaming-grade NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics. Its astonishing processing power shames most desktops, and its ultra-fast 512GB PCIe SSD storage delivers superb responsiveness. Thinner Edges, More Display The 15.6-inch NanoEdge multi-touch display of the ZenBook Pro is truly remarkable. Along with FHD resolution and 178° wide-view technology, it features an incredibly thin bezel along all four edges of the screen. This super-slim bezel is just 7.3mm wide at its narrowest point, providing a screen-to-body ratio of 83% so you see more display and less frame. The projected capacitive touch technology of the NanoEdge display has 10-point multi-touch support, so you can use multi-finger gestures for totally intuitive navigation and control. It also supports the ASUS Pen for ultra-precise sketching, writing or annotating. Gaming-grade Graphics ZenBook Pro uses up to the latest NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti gaming-grade graphics with 4GB of GDDR5 video memory to deliver performance that’s nearly twice as fast as a GeForce GTX 960M GPU.### ###",,,DDR4 SDRAM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

### ###Performance you can count: With the responsiveness and efficiency of 7th generation Intel Core processors, the Lenovo ThinkPad T570 lets you switch effortlessly between your favorite apps—increasing your productivity, creativity, or entertainment levels along the way. Super fast SSD storage: Unlike a regular mechanical hard drive, a Solid-State Drive (SSD) has no moving parts and performs faster—including booting up (nearly 3X quicker), opening files (as much as 30% faster), and transferring files (around 200 MB/s, compared to the regular 50-120 MB/s). As well as being quieter, it’s also more reliable, more rugged, and more secure. Tested for battle, built for success: Every ThinkPad laptop undergoes 12 stringent military tests and over 200 quality checks. So, you can rest easy knowing that your T570 is more than capable of surviving the bumps and bruises of everyday life. User-friendly, business-friendly: Easy to set up and roll out, the T570 is also quick to service, upgrade, and secure. From an everyday user to an IT technician, this business laptop is designed to make life (and work) easier for everyone. Less really is more: The T570 is available with Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Signature Edition. Now, you can say goodbye to unwanted trial ware, apps, or distractions. And hello to a faster laptop, from startup to shut down and everything in between. Forgot your password? With Windows Hello’s fingerprint technology, there’s no need to worry about remembering your password. Simply touch the fingerprint scanner to log in, quickly and securely. Prepare to be thunderstruck: The T570 includes Intel Thunderbolt 3—the technology that brings lightning-fast Thunderbolt to USB-C at speeds up to 40 Gbps. Connect a cable from your USB-C port to a Thunderbolt 3-enabled device, and get four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other port type, while also supplying power. So you get Thunderbolt, USB-C, and DisplayPort. Plus, you can even output to two 4K displays with the Thunderbolt Dock.### ###",,,Unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
